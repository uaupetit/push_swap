# Push Swap

This project, called Push Swap, is part of the curriculum at 42. The main objective of Push Swap is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of instructions, with the smallest number of operations possible.

## Project Description

The project consists of two programs:

1. **push_swap**: This program takes a list of integers as arguments and sorts them using two stacks and a set of predefined instructions.
   
2. **checker**: This program checks if a list of integers is sorted. It takes the same list of integers and instructions as the push_swap program, but instead of sorting the list, it verifies if the list would be sorted correctly by the push_swap program.

## Compiling the Programs

To compile the programs, simply run:

```bash
make
./push_swap 4 67 2 8 12
./checker 3 2 1 0
